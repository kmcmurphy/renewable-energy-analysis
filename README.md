This project will focus on analyzing renewable energy and the production/usage across different regions and countries. We would like to focus on the contrast between energy usage and consumption in different areas. We would also like to look for trends across time.

We believe this is an important topic to examine as sustainability and climate change are critical to our future. By analyzing the usage and production of renewable energy in each country, we hope to investigate each country's commitment to more sustainable sources for energy.
